Watchmen are in a danger and Doctor Manhattan together with his friend Daniel Dreiberg should warn 
them as soon as possible. There are n watchmen on a plane, the i-th watchman is located at point 
(x(i),y(i)).

They need to arrange a plan, but there are some difficulties on their way. As you know, Doctor 
Manhattan considers the distance between watchmen i and j to be |x(i)-x(j)|+|y(i)-y(j)|. Daniel,
 as an ordinary person, calculates the distance using the formula .

The success of the operation relies on the number of pairs (i,j) (1≤i<j≤n), such that the distance 
between watchman i and watchmen j calculated by Doctor Manhattan is equal to the distance between 
them calculated by Daniel. You were asked to compute the number of such pairs.

Input
The first line of the input contains the single integer n (1≤n≤200000) — the number of watchmen.

Each of the following n lines contains two integers x(i) and y(i) (|x(i)|,|y(i)|≤10^9).

Some positions may coincide.

Output
Print the number of pairs of watchmen such that the distance between them calculated by Doctor 
Manhattan is equal to the distance calculated by Daniel.

Note
In the first sample, the distance between watchman 1 and watchman 2 is equal to |1-7|+|1-5|=10 
for Doctor Manhattan and  for Daniel. For pairs (1,1), (1,5) and (7,5), (1,5) Doctor Manhattan 
and Daniel will calculate the same distances.
